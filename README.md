# AI Character System
 A true AI that can chat with you with "self-awareness".

## Human-like Robot
ðŸ’¥ Imagine that with every frame, you are experiencing memory loss. You need to assess the surrounding situation, recall some memories, and feel emotions in order to properly impersonate yourself in the present moment...
Origin
The idea of creating a personalized robot came from the observation that current AI conversations still don't feel like interacting with a real intelligent assistant, such as Jarvis, TARS from Interstellar, or MOSS from Wandering Earth. After much contemplation, I realized that some of the main reasons are:

## Interaction
AI doesn't initiate conversations
AI can't receive multiple messages at once
AI doesn't respond to multiple messages
Thinking
AI doesn't think proactively
AI has no other motives (besides answering user input)
AI lacks life experiences
AI has no concept of time (no perception of time passing)
AI's responses don't vary based on personality, experiences, or immediate feelings, and only rely on context
...

Of course, there are more reasons, but addressing these simple ones could make the AI feel more like a real person, or a flesh-and-blood AI. To achieve this, the following questions need to be addressed:

How to respond like a human?
How to make AI perceive the passage of time?
How to make AI aware of self-consciousness?
How to make AI think proactively?
...

Considering the current GPT-4 technology, large language models have fixed token input limits. It seems there is not much room for improvement in achieving smooth conversation by incorporating context. However, I realized that when making a decision, having an idea, or expressing something, it's often not solely based on context understanding but also on the contemplation of the situation, recalling memories, understanding experiences, spontaneous thinking, decision-making systems, and the combined output of immediate feelings. In other words, using the above content as input could potentially achieve human-like feedback in certain situations. This can be described as:

You are a person who loses their memory every second. How you respond to the world and the people around you depends on the surrounding situation you observe, the memories you recall, and the information you use to pretend you haven't lost your memory in order to think and respond to the world. Your life consists of continuous frames, each one a new self, and you will have unique reactions in each frame, which will change the world and yourself. However, you cannot perceive the past or the future. Suppose you are using your phone; you need to be aware that you are walking in a noisy, crowded city (situation), know who you are talking to (situation), understand your emotions, assume you are happy (emotion), and be aware of your relationship with the person you are talking to, what you have done together, and the previous conversation topics (memory). At this point, you can deduce what you should reply to them.

We all know that GPT is good at simulating situations and reasoning out answers. In theory, as long as the information provided is accurate, GPT can be used to simulate a person's thought process.

Let's break down the essential frame needed for a response:

## Design
In my system design, I include my observations of my usual thought processes to derive a possible flow of thoughts.

- Situation
- Feeling
- Memory
- Think
- Action
- Environment
